Chemical Engineer specialized in <b>Data Analysis and Business Intelligence</b>, focused on building scalable, business-driven analytical solutions. I work primarily with <b>Power BI at an advanced level</b>, with strong emphasis on data modeling, Power Query and DAX optimization, as well as ETL pipelines and SQL.

I have experience delivering projects within BI and PMO environments, managing end-to-end requirements, coordinating interdisciplinary teams, and acting as a liaison between clients, technical teams, and multiple workstreams. I have worked with complex datasets across healthcare, pharmaceutical supply chain, and biotech, ensuring data quality, traceability, and alignment with business goals.

I am currently expanding my skill set in Power Apps and Power Automate for process automation and low-code solutions, and I also use Tableau for data visualization. I bring strong analytical skills that enable me to provide clarity to complex problems and generate actionable, data-driven insights.
